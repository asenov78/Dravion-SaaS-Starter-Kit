# Changelog

All notable changes to Dravion SaaS Starter Kit.

## [1.10.73] — 2026-06-20

### Fixed
- **"Check again" now re-checks both license and updates**: replaced plain anchor links with POST forms pointing to new `POST /admin/updates/check-all` route; action clears `license.cache` and `github_latest_version` cache so LicenseCheck middleware does a live ping and `index()` fetches fresh GitHub releases
- `index()` now writes `github_latest_version` cache after every GitHub fetch, keeping sidebar badge in sync without needing a webhook

### Added
- `POST /admin/updates/check-all` route (`admin.updates.check-all`) and `checkAll()` controller method
- 7 new tests in `CheckAllTest` covering auth guards, cache clearing, flash message, and blade form rendering

## [1.10.72] — 2026-06-20

### Changed
- **One version per click**: Updates page now installs exactly one version per button press; shows only the next (oldest) pending version with its changelog; displays "+N more pending" badge when multiple updates are queued; on successful install reloads the page to show the next version
- `zip_url` validation now explicitly requires `string` type to prevent batch payloads
- 3 new tests in `UpdatePageTest` covering single-version display, pending count badge, and foreign-host URL rejection

## [1.10.71] — 2026-06-20

### Added
- **Updates nav badge**: pulse green dot + "UPDATE" badge in sidebar next to Updates link when a newer version is available in cache (`github_latest_version`)
- 8 new tests in `UpdateNavBadgeTest` covering badge presence/absence, version comparison, v-prefix handling, non-admin exclusion, and blade rendering

## [1.10.70] — 2026-06-20

### Added
- **Check License button** on Updates page: replaces "Go to License" link with a POST form that clears `storage/license.cache` and does a live license ping; redirects with success flash if license is now active, or warning flash if not
- `POST /admin/updates/check-license` route (`admin.updates.check-license`)
- `UpdateController::checkLicense()` method
- 7 new tests in `CheckLicenseTest` covering auth, role guard, stale cache bypass, success and warning redirects, and blade button presence

## [1.10.59] — 2026-06-20

### Fixed
- `GET /admin/license` now redirects to `admin.updates` — combined License & Updates page is the single entry point; separate license-only page no longer exists as a destination

## [1.10.58] — 2026-06-20

### Fixed
- Updates+license page: activate/remove license form now redirects back to `/admin/updates` instead of `/admin/license` — combined page stays intact after license actions
- Updates page: reverted to `isValid()` (cache, fast) on page load; live check stays only in `install()` and `check()` endpoints
- Admin layout: license blur no longer applies on `/admin/license` route (content was blurred/unusable without a key)
- `LicenseController`: `_back` hidden field (whitelist-validated) controls redirect target; unknown values fall back to `admin.license`

## [1.10.57] — 2026-06-20

### Added
- GitHub release webhook (`POST /webhook/github/releases`) — GitHub pushes notification when a Release is published; admin header automatically shows a version badge without requiring "Check Again"
- `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` env var for HMAC-SHA256 signature verification of webhook payloads
- `updates.new_version_available` translation key (EN + BG)
- 8 `UpdateWebhookTest` tests covering signature verification, event filtering, cache behavior
- 3 `LicensePageTest` flash message tests verifying `license_activated` ≠ `license_removed` in both locales

### Changed
- Updates page (`/admin/updates`) now uses `isValidLive()` — live license check on every page load catches suspended/revoked keys before showing download URLs

### Security
- Webhook HMAC-SHA256 verified via `hash_equals()` — rejects tampered or unsigned payloads when secret is configured

## [1.10.56] — 2026-06-20
### Fix
- Add missing GET /dashboard route + DashboardController + view for regular users (fixed Route [dashboard] not defined in 7+ tests)
- Add missing GET /admin/license route + LicenseController::show() + admin/license.blade.php (fixed Route [admin.license] not defined in 10+ tests)
- LicenseController::update() + remove() redirect to route('admin.license') instead of back() (fixed redirect assertions in tests)
- Storage route realpath() path-traversal check: use realpath($base) for comparison to handle mixed Windows separators (fixed 2 StorageSymlinkTest 404s)
- UpdaterServiceTest: use app(UpdaterService::class) instead of new UpdaterService() (fixed 7 constructor errors)
- Result: 583/585 tests pass (2 skipped = Windows-only symlink creation)

## [1.10.55] — 2026-06-20
### Security / Arch
- License security: isValidLive() + verifyNow() — real-time server ping on update check and install (blocks suspended/revoked licenses even with valid 24h cache)
- UpdateController::check() hides zip_url when license invalid; install() aborts 403 immediately
- LicenseService: fail-open on server unreachable (cached=valid → allow; no cache → block)
- ActivityLogger Facade (App\Facades\ActivityLogger) — proper Laravel Facade replaces broken __callStatic pattern (PHP 8.3 incompatible)
- All 7 callers migrated from App\Services\ActivityLogger to App\Facades\ActivityLogger
- NullActivityLogger bound in tests via AppServiceProvider — no stray DB writes in test suite
- 56 new tests in LicenseSecurityTest: isValid, verifyNow, isValidLive, critical activate→suspend→block scenario, check/install endpoints, activate(), cache integrity (HMAC tamper), access control

## [1.10.54] — 2026-06-20
### Arch
- AvatarService: guard imagecreatefromstring() false return — throw RuntimeException instead of fatal error on corrupt upload (Candidate 6)
- DomainHelper::maskKey(): dedup mask() from LicenseController + UpdateController — single source of truth (Candidate 7)
- UpdateController: use DomainHelper::maskKey(), remove private mask()
- LicenseController: remove dead private mask() method

## [1.10.53] — 2026-06-20
### Arch
- Extract DomainHelper (app/Support/DomainHelper.php): isDevDomain() + fromAppUrl() — eliminates duplicated private method in LicenseService and LicenseCheck
- LicenseService + LicenseCheck: replace private isDevDomain() with DomainHelper::isDevDomain()

## [1.10.52] — 2026-06-20
### Arch
- Setting::get() request-scoped static cache — eliminates repeated DB queries per request (31 call-sites, up to 20 per admin settings page)
- Setting::set() / setMany() invalidate cache on write — no stale reads
- Setting::flushCache() helper for test isolation between assertions
- app/Support/Settings.php: typed constants for all 20+ known setting keys

## [1.10.51] — 2026-06-20
### Arch
- ActivityLogger: static → injectable via ActivityLoggerInterface contract
- Static callers unchanged (__callStatic delegates to container) — zero diff in 9 caller files
- NullActivityLogger (no-op): bind in tests to skip DB; eliminates spatie activitylog dependency from unit tests
- AppServiceProvider: bind ActivityLoggerInterface → ActivityLogger (singleton-style via container)
- UpdaterServiceSortTest: fix constructor call after UpdaterService became DI-injected

## [1.10.50] — 2026-06-20
### Arch
- Decompose UpdaterService God object: extract ReleaseDownloader, ReleaseInstaller, UpdateHistory into app/Services/Updater/
- UpdaterService becomes thin orchestrator (~80 lines, was 363) delegating to focused collaborators
- UpdateHistory: 4 unit tests covering append/accumulation/empty-changelog
- Each collaborator has single responsibility — testable in isolation without mocking Laravel internals

## [1.10.49] — 2026-06-18
### Arch
- Extract HtmlSanitizer service (app/Services/HtmlSanitizer.php) from PagesController private method — 17 unit tests, covers XSS/CSS-exfil/javascript:/data: vectors
- PagesController: inject HtmlSanitizer, remove 80-line embedded sanitizeContent()/domSanitize() methods

## [1.10.48] — 2026-06-18
### Fixed
- GitHub Actions: revert softprops/action-gh-release to @v2 tag — SHA was incorrect and broke CI

## [1.10.47] — 2026-06-18
### Security
- PagesController::domSanitize(): strip url()/expression()/behavior()/vbscript() from style attributes — blocks CSS data exfiltration
- SecurityHeaders middleware: X-Frame-Options DENY, X-Content-Type-Options nosniff, Referrer-Policy, X-XSS-Protection, Permissions-Policy on all web responses
- GitHub Actions: SHA-pinned actions/checkout, actions/setup-node, softprops/action-gh-release — prevents tag-hijack supply chain attack
- LicenseCheck: log warning when license server unreachable (fail-open remains, now traceable)

## [1.10.46] — 2026-06-18
### Fixed
- Portal unlicensed banner: was added to wrong file (welcome.blade.php); public portal uses layouts/public.blade.php — banner now correctly in that layout, visible on all public pages
- Admin app-header: globe icon (View Site) now opens in same window instead of new tab

## [1.10.45] — 2026-06-18
### Fixed
- welcome.blade.php (public portal page at /dravion/): add unlicensed warning banner — this page is standalone HTML and does not use x-layouts.portal, so the banner had to be added directly here

## [1.10.44] — 2026-06-18
### Fixed
- CRITICAL: MenuHelper.php called route('admin.license') which no longer exists — caused 500 on every page after v1.10.42

## [1.10.43] — 2026-06-18
### Changed
- Admin layout: blur reduced to 2px; license check now reads config() directly instead of session — works on all pages including /sessions and /api-tokens which bypass license.check middleware
- Portal layout: thin warning bar when no license key is configured
- Added license.no_license_portal translation key (EN + BG)

## [1.10.42] — 2026-06-18
### Removed
- `/admin/license` GET route and `admin/license.blade.php` view — license management is now fully on the License & Updates page
- `LicenseController::show()` method removed (POST/DELETE still exist for form actions)
### Changed
- All links to `admin.license` updated to `admin.updates`: app-header badge, updates page "Go to License" button
- Blur exception updated to `admin.updates` only (no longer needs to exclude the removed license page)

## [1.10.41] — 2026-06-18
### Changed
- Admin layout: page content blurs (filter:blur 4px, pointer-events:none) when license_warning is active, except on License & Updates and License pages where the admin can actually fix the issue

## [1.10.40] — 2026-06-18
### Fixed
- License activate/remove now log to activity log (category: license, events: activated/removed)
- License warning banner now shows in admin layout when session('license_warning') is set — previously the warning was flashed to session but never displayed anywhere; banner links directly to License & Updates page
- Added activity translation keys: license_activated, license_removed (EN + BG)

## [1.10.39] — 2026-06-18
### Changed
- Updates page renamed to "License & Updates": replaced small license link card with full license management UI (status, key input, activate/remove); layout changed from 3-col to 2-col; LicenseController now uses redirect()->back() so form works from both the license page and the updates page

## [1.10.38] — 2026-06-18
### Changed
- Settings page: 2-column grid layout (General+System+ActivityLog left, PublicSite+Logo+Email+License right) — reduces page height ~50%

## [1.10.37] — 2026-06-18
### Fixed
- Logo and avatar images: replaced all Storage::url() calls in views with url('storage/'.$path) — url() uses Symfony SCRIPT_NAME detection (same as route generation, proven correct) and is unaffected by Apache system env APP_URL override; fixed in 12 view locations across sidebar, header, public layout, user-dropdown, profile-card, dashboard, settings, users pages
- AppServiceProvider: removed risky URL::forceRootUrl() call; storage disk URL now fixed using url('storage') which uses the same correct mechanism as route generation

## [1.10.36] — 2026-06-18
### Fixed
- Storage image URLs (logo, avatars): use request()->root() from Symfony HttpFoundation instead of env('APP_URL') — bypasses Apache system env var that overrides .env subdirectory path; applies to both URL::forceRootUrl() and filesystems.disks.public.url

## [1.10.35] — 2026-06-18
### Removed
- `/dashboard` route, `dashboard.blade.php` view, and all `route('dashboard')` references — portal is `/` (home), admin panel is `/admin/dashboard`

## [1.10.34] — 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- Storage images: root cause found — Apache exports APP_URL system env var without subdirectory path; Laravel Dotenv::createImmutable() keeps system env and ignores .env, so config('app.url') and getenv() both return wrong host-only URL; fixed by resolveAppUrl() which reads SCRIPT_NAME from live HTTP request (always correct) and falls back to reading .env file directly

## [1.10.33] — 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- Storage images: call `Storage::forgetDisk('public')` after overriding the disk URL in AppServiceProvider — FilesystemManager caches the adapter with URL baked in on first access, so config() change alone had no effect on already-created adapters

## [1.10.32] — 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- Updater: reverted to old design (Blade conditionals, all changelogs visible); sequential AJAX install still active — button installs all pending versions oldest-first, no page reload; "up to date" state shown inline when done
- diag.php v3: fixed `define(LARAVEL_START)` error; proper Laravel boot for accurate Storage::url() diagnostics

## [1.10.31] — 2026-06-17
### Changed
- Updater: installs versions one at a time (oldest first) instead of jumping to latest; each install is AJAX — no full page reload; pill badges show progress (step N of M); after each success the next version is shown with its own Install button; when all done the panel switches to "up to date" state without reload

## [1.10.30] — 2026-06-17
### Security
- CRITICAL: Path traversal in `GET /storage/{path}` — `realpath()` + prefix check now blocks `../../` escapes from `storage/app/public/`
- HIGH: CMS XSS — replaced `strip_tags()` (allowed event handlers on permitted tags) with DOMDocument sanitizer that explicitly whitelists attributes per tag and strips all `on*` handlers and `javascript:`/`data:` URI schemes
### Fixed
- Storage images: `AppServiceProvider` now overrides `filesystems.disks.public.url` from live env (via `getenv()`) — works even when config cache has stale APP_URL baked in
- Storage images: `index.php` clears `bootstrap/cache/config.php` when APP_URL is auto-corrected — next request starts fresh

## [1.10.29] — 2026-06-17
### Performance
- Cache DB translations 24h per locale+group → eliminates repeated DB queries on every page load (main TTFB fix)
- Bust translation cache automatically when admin saves translations via LanguageController
- Preload Onest woff2 in `<head>` → font starts loading in parallel with CSS, not after
- Remove unused Inter Google Font from admin layout (Onest is the project font)
- Fix sidebar CLS: inline script reads localStorage before Alpine initialises, sets `--sidebar-init-w` CSS var → sidebar renders at correct width immediately, no layout shift

## [1.10.28] — 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- Storage images actual root cause: `APP_URL` in `.env` was `https://apsbg.com` (missing `/dravion` subdirectory) → `Storage::url()` generated wrong URLs pointing to the main site instead of the Dravion subdirectory; `index.php` now auto-detects and self-heals `APP_URL` when the stored value is missing the install subdirectory

## [1.10.27] — 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- Storage images root cause fix: root `.htaccess` was rewriting `storage/xxx` → `public/storage/xxx`, causing Apache to restart with a new path that made Laravel see `REQUEST_URI = /dravion/public/storage/xxx` — no route matches, 404. Fix: removed `storage/.+` from root `.htaccess` rewrite; all storage requests now fall directly to `index.php` → Laravel `storage.serve` route serves the file correctly

## [1.10.26] — 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- Storage images: removed `serve:true` from public disk — it was registering a framework route that shadowed the explicit `GET /storage/{path}` route in web.php; now only the web.php route exists and correctly serves files from `storage/app/public/`

## [1.10.25] — 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- Storage auto-heal on every boot (`AppServiceProvider`): detects broken `public/storage` symlink → removes it → recreates (absolute then relative fallback); broken symlink caused Apache to 404 before reaching PHP
- `.htaccess`: force `/storage/` paths through PHP regardless of symlink state
- 4 new tests: broken symlink removed, serve route works, 404 on missing, URL format

## [1.10.24] — 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- Avatar and logo images not loading: added `GET /storage/{path}` PHP route that serves files directly from `storage/app/public/` — guaranteed to work on shared hosting without symlink; Apache's `.htaccess` rewrite falls through to PHP when the symlink is absent

## [1.10.23] — 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- Avatar and logo images not loading on shared hosting: added `serve: true` to `public` filesystem disk — Laravel now serves `storage/app/public` files via built-in route (`GET /storage/{path}`) without requiring a working symlink
- InstallController: fallback relative symlink (`../../storage/app/public`) when `php artisan storage:link` fails (relative symlinks work on most cPanel setups where absolute symlinks fail)
- Removed `serve: true` from `local` disk to prevent route conflict with `public` disk at `/storage`
- Added `StorageLinkTest` covering disk config, `serve:true`, and avatar upload URL

## [1.10.22] — 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- Notification bell dot: uses inline `style` instead of Tailwind classes — Tailwind v4 purges dynamic `:class` bindings; dot now always visible (gray=0 unread, orange+pulsing=unread)
- `markRead` and `markAll`: use `route()` helpers instead of hardcoded `/notifications/...` — fixes broken mark-read on subdirectory hosting (`/dravion/`)
- Unread item background and icon colors: switched to inline styles to survive Tailwind purge

## [1.10.21] — 2026-06-17
### Changed
- Notification bell: always shows a small dot indicator — gray when 0 unread, orange+pulsing when unread > 0

## [1.10.20] — 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- Notification dropdown overflow: use `position:absolute; right:0` (inline style) instead of `-right-[240px] lg:right-0` — Tailwind v4 purges unused responsive variants; dropdown no longer expands the page
- Notification bell badge: reverted to simple pulsing dot (copy-paste from original TailAdmin) — count badge was causing visual issues

## [1.10.19] — 2026-06-17
### Changed
- Notification bell: unread items now have distinct orange background (`bg-orange-50` / dark equivalent) vs read items; unread count badge on bell button (number with pulsing animation, shows `9+` when over 9); each notification item now shows a bell icon area, title+body in TailAdmin style, and `Notification • time` meta row
### Fixed
- Security (MEDIUM): CMS page content sanitized via `strip_tags()` with allowed safe HTML tags before saving — prevents stored XSS when content rendered with `{!! !!}` in public views

## [1.10.18] — 2026-06-17
### Changed
- Notification bell redesigned to match original TailAdmin: `rounded-full` button, filled bell SVG, pulsing orange `animate-ping` dot badge (replaces number badge), dropdown `rounded-2xl` with X close button and unread orange dot per item

## [1.10.17] — 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- `UpdaterService`: read changelog from `CHANGELOG.md` in the extracted ZIP (not from GitHub release body which is often empty) — `detectChangelogFromExtract()` parses the matching `## [version]` section via regex

## [1.10.16] — 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- Update history accordion now stores and displays changelog per entry — JS passes `changelog` alongside `zip_url` on install; stored in `history.json`; view shows "Show changelog" toggle same as before

## [1.10.15] — 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- `UpdaterService::ensureHistoryExists()`: bootstrap fix — if `history.json` doesn't exist but `install.lock` does, seeds the file with the current version on first page load (handles manual ZIP deploys that predate history tracking)
- Update history accordion: entries with `from = —` (bootstrapped) show only the installed version without an arrow

## [1.10.14] — 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- Update history accordion now shows only updates actually installed via the updater (tracked in `storage/app/updates/history.json`), not all older GitHub releases — fresh install shows 0 history entries
- Each history entry: from version → to version + timestamp
- Added `UpdaterService::getUpdateHistory()` and `appendToHistory()` helpers

## [1.10.13] — 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- `UpdaterService::downloadAndInstall()`: after copying files, explicitly reads new version from extracted `config/dravion.php` and writes it to the protected local config — fixes infinite update loop where version never bumped after successful install
- `opcache_reset()` called after update to ensure updated PHP files served immediately

## [1.10.12] — 2026-06-17
### Added
- `InstallSeeder` — central entry point for all installer data seeding; installer calls only this, never anything else
- `DefaultLanguagesSeeder` — seeds en + bg languages via `insertOrIgnore`
- `DefaultSettingsSeeder` — seeds all app settings with defaults via `firstOrCreate` (safe to run on existing data)
- `DefaultPagesSeeder` — seeds home, about, pricing, contact, gallery pages with hero images via `firstOrCreate`
### Changed
- `InstallController::handleFinish()`: replaced manual `RolesAndPermissionsSeeder` + inline language insert with `db:seed --class=InstallSeeder` — installer never needs touching for new default data
### Rule
- New feature shipping default data → create `database/seeders/YourFeatureSeeder.php` + add `$this->call(YourFeatureSeeder::class)` to `InstallSeeder`. Installer stays untouched.

## [1.10.11] — 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- `routes/web.php` `/` route: also check DB connectivity when `install.lock` exists — redirects to `/install` if lock exists but DB is broken/unconfigured
- `InstallController` database step: two-phase flow — Phase 1 tests connection, Phase 2 shows confirmation-only page (no re-entering credentials); `?reset=1` clears session and returns to Phase 1
- `database.blade.php`: separate confirmation view with amber warning, checkbox, "Drop & Reinstall" and "Change credentials" buttons

## [1.10.10] — 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- `index.php`: auto-detect `APP_URL` from `HTTP_HOST` + `SCRIPT_NAME` when value is `http://localhost` placeholder — fixes redirect from `/` to `/install` in subdirectory installs (e.g. `/dravion/`) AND at domain root
- `InstallController` database step: detect existing tables in target DB; require explicit `confirm_drop` checkbox before proceeding; run `migrate:fresh` on finish if tables existed
- `database.blade.php`: show amber warning banner + confirm checkbox when existing tables detected

## [1.10.9] — 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- `routes/web.php` `/` route: removed `Schema::hasTable('settings')` check — it was throwing DB exception when credentials are empty (pre-install); now redirects to `/install` based on `install.lock` only
- `InstallGuard`: if `install.lock` exists but DB connection fails, allow installer to run again — fixes 404 on `/install` when lock file is stale from a broken previous install attempt

## [1.10.8] — 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- `index.php`: if neither `.env` nor `.env.installer` exist, generate a minimal `.env` with a fresh random `APP_KEY` directly — eliminates `MissingAppKeyException` on servers where `.env.installer` is missing or the copy fails silently

## [1.10.7] — 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- `index.php`: generate real random `APP_KEY` via `openssl_random_pseudo_bytes(32)` when missing or empty in `.env` — handles both empty line and missing line cases; sets via `putenv`/`$_ENV`/`$_SERVER` so Laravel picks it up before dotenv runs

## [1.10.6] — 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- `index.php`: auto-create `bootstrap/cache` and `storage/` skeleton dirs at runtime — eliminates "directory must be present and writable" crash on shared hosting where ZIP extraction skips empty directories

## [1.10.5] — 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- `make-full-zip.ps1`: rewritten for PowerShell 5.1 compatibility (removed `?.` null-conditional operator)

## [1.10.4] — 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- `index.php`: inject installer `APP_KEY` when `.env` exists but key is empty — fixes `MissingAppKeyException` on shared hosting if `.env` was uploaded without a key
- `make-full-zip.ps1`: write `.gitkeep` in all skeleton dirs (logs, sessions, views, cache, bootstrap/cache) so ZIP preserves them — fixes `Please provide a valid cache path` on first boot

## [1.10.3] — 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- `.htaccess`: removed complex dynamic RewriteBase detection — Apache handles relative substitutions correctly in subdirectory `.htaccess` automatically; works at domain root AND in `/dravion/` subdirectory

## [1.10.2] — 2026-06-16
### Fixed
- `index.php`: friendly "vendor/ missing" message instead of blank 500 on incomplete upload
- `SetLocale` middleware: catches DB exception before install (settings table doesn't exist yet)
- `MaintenanceMode` middleware: catches DB exception before install
- `.env.installer`: removed SQLite/tmp dependency — uses mysql with empty credentials
- All pre-install requests now survive without crashing before reaching `/install`

## [1.10.1] — 2026-06-16
### Fixed
- Release ZIP now includes `vendor/` and `public/build/` (built by GitHub Actions) — required for shared hosting installation without separate `composer install`
- `make-full-zip.ps1` rewritten: copies to temp via robocopy, runs `composer install --no-dev`, then zips — avoids locked-file issues on Windows
- `UpdaterService::getReleases()` sorts by semver, not GitHub publish date

## [1.10.0] — 2026-06-16
### Added
- Installer tests: 38 tests covering all 5 steps (requirements/database/admin/license/finish), views, validation, session flow, install lock, admin user creation
- `InstallGuardTest`: 8 tests — lock file blocks all routes (404), accessible without lock, invalid step 404
- `bootstrapEnv()` in `InstallController`: auto-creates `.env` from `.env.example` at requirements step, forces `SESSION_DRIVER=file` so install works on shared hosting before DB exists
- Installer: `seedDefaultLanguage()` inserts default English language row on finish
- Installer: `storage:link` attempt on finish (non-fatal on restrictive shared hosting)
- Installer: creates all required `storage/` subdirs on finish (framework/sessions, framework/cache/data, etc.)
- Installer: requires cURL + GD extensions in requirements check
- `writeEnv()`: adds `APP_LOCALE`, `APP_FALLBACK_LOCALE`, `FILESYSTEM_DISK=local`, full `MAIL_*` defaults
### Fixed
- `User` model: added `email_verified_at` to `#[Fillable]` — `firstOrCreate()` now correctly sets it, preventing redirect to email verification on first admin login
- `RegisterController::store()`: added `Setting::get('registration')` check — direct `POST /register` no longer bypasses the registration-disabled toggle
### Security
- Language routes (`/admin/languages/*`) now gated by `can:manage languages` permission (admin-only); previously accessible to any `editor` role
- `manage languages` permission added to `RolesAndPermissionsSeeder` — assigned to `admin` only

## [1.9.0] — 2026-06-16
### Added
- `App\Contracts\LicenseServiceInterface` — contract for DI binding and mockability
- `LicenseService` now implements `LicenseServiceInterface` (instance methods only)
- `AppServiceProvider` binds `LicenseServiceInterface` → `LicenseService` in the container
- `LicenseController`, `UpdateController`, `LicenseCheck` middleware, `InstallController` inject `LicenseServiceInterface` via constructor DI
- Installer requirements check: added cURL and GD extension checks, bumped PHP requirement label to 8.3
- Installer `.env` generation: `APP_NAME` now properly escaped via `EnvWriter::escapeValue()`, added `DRAVION_LICENSE_SERVER` entry
- `config/google2fa.php` added to updater protected paths
### Changed
- All tests updated to use `app(LicenseServiceInterface::class)` instead of static `LicenseService::*` calls

## [1.8.0] — 2026-06-16
### Added
- Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP) with `pragmarx/google2fa-laravel` + `bacon/bacon-qr-code`
- `TwoFactorController`: setup (QR code), confirm, disable, challenge, verify actions
- Login gate: users with 2FA enabled are redirected to TOTP challenge before session is created
- Migration: `two_factor_secret` + `two_factor_confirmed_at` columns on users table
- Views: `auth/two-factor/setup.blade.php`, `manage.blade.php`, `challenge.blade.php`
- Profile page: 2FA card with link to enable/manage
- Lang keys: `auth.2fa_*` (en + bg), `flash.2fa_enabled`, `flash.2fa_disabled`
- TwoFactorTest: 12 tests covering full 2FA lifecycle
### Security
- #21: TOTP 2FA added — eliminates password-only auth risk for admin accounts

## [1.7.0] — 2026-06-16
### Added
- EnvWriter service: atomic `.env` writes with `flock()` — eliminates race condition on concurrent admin requests
- Failed login attempts now logged to activity log (causer + masked email) — A09 Logging Failures fix
- `config/dravion.php` added to updater protected paths — never overwritten by self-update
- SessionManagementTest: 5 tests for session listing and logout-other-devices
- PublicPagesTest: 10 tests for HomeController (home/gallery/CMS pages) and ContactController
### Fixed
- `.env` password escaping: `addslashes()` replaced with `EnvWriter::escapeValue()` — handles `$`, `#`, spaces correctly
- LicenseController and InstallController now use EnvWriter (no more raw `file_put_contents` on `.env`)
### Security
- #36: Failed login attempts logged with email + IP to activity_log
- #37: `.env` write race condition fixed via EnvWriter with exclusive flock()

## [1.6.0] — 2026-06-16
### Added
- TipTap editor: independent scroll on both editor and live preview panes
- TipTap editor: resize handle bar at bottom — drag to resize height (min 200px)
- TipTap editor: HTML source view font increased to 14px
- TipTap preview: `display:flex` via CSS class (`.tiptap-preview-pane`) — fixes Alpine x-show overriding flex scroll
- TipTap auto-scroll: preview scrolls only its own panel (`panel.scrollTop`) not the page
### Fixed
- Preview scroll broken: `x-show` was setting `display:block` over inline `display:flex`, preventing flex scrolling
- Resize handles inside panes were clipped by `overflow:hidden` — moved to sibling resize bar
- `overflow:hidden` on tiptap container now correctly clips both panes while resize bar (sibling) remains accessible

## [1.5.0] — 2026-06-16
### Added
- TipTap editor with live split-pane preview (real-time sync, auto-scroll to cursor position)
- HTML source view with auto-formatting via js-beautify
- Pages permissions: granular `can:` middleware guards on all CRUD routes
- Pages group added to Roles permission matrix (view/create/edit/delete)
- Installer: `app_name` field (was hardcoded "Dravion")
- Installer: try/catch around migrate and seed — user-friendly error on failure
### Fixed
- TipTap buttons not working — Alpine Proxy wrapped editor broke ProseMirror state equality
- TipTap preview: duplicate class= attribute bug fixed
- `hero_cta_url` now validated as `url` (blocks javascript: XSS scheme)
- `footer_copyright` escaped with `{{ }}` instead of `{!! !!}` (stored XSS fix)
- Editor and preview fonts unified: Onest 15px/1.75, cms-content moved to app.css
### Security
- Pages routes: added `can:` middleware per action (view/create/edit/delete)
- concurrently upgraded 9.2.1→10.0.3 (shell-quote CVE GHSA-w7jw-789q-3m8p CVSS 8.1)
- Installer: license field label changed from "(optional)" to required

## [1.4.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added

- Contact page (`/contact`): form saved to DB + optional email, info cards
- Gallery page (`/gallery`): component showcase with CSS mockups
- CMS pages: admin CRUD for public pages with hero image, title, subtitle, CTA fields (editable per page from admin)
- Hero background images (Unsplash) on home, contact, gallery — dark overlay + grid pattern
- Public layout: matches admin header design — same theme toggle (sun/moon SVGs), language switcher, logo from Settings, user dropdown with avatar
- Admin sidebar: logo from Settings, app name from Settings (no more hardcoded "DRAVION")
- Admin header: logo + app name dynamic on mobile header
- Settings: new "Public Site" section — header tagline, footer text, footer copyright editable from admin
- Footer: uses app_name from Settings, shows footer_text + footer_copyright settings
- Sessions and API tokens pages: smart layout (admin vs portal) + dark mode fixes
- `View Site` globe button in admin header → opens public site in new tab

### Changed
- Root `/` serves public home page (not redirect to dashboard); install check preserved
- All public pages use `app_name` from Settings (not hardcoded config)
- Pages migration: added `hero_image`, `hero_title`, `hero_subtitle`, `hero_cta_label`, `hero_cta_url` fields

## [1.3.1] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- Updates page: per-version changelog — every release newer than the current version is listed with its notes, newest first, with a "latest" badge
### Changed
- Updater integrates with license: latest version is always visible (even unlicensed), but download/install stays license-gated
- `UpdaterService` now reads the full GitHub releases list instead of only the latest release

## [1.3.0] — 2026-06-15
### Added
- Self-updater: admin-only `/admin/updates` — checks GitHub releases, license-gated, one-click install (maintenance mode, file copy, migrate, cache clear)
- `LicenseService` + `UpdaterService`; `config/updater.php`; release workflow on `v*.*.*` tags
- Avatar upload for users & profile (GD resize to 200px), shown in dashboard/user lists
- Settings: logo upload, SMTP test button, welcome-email toggle
- Dashboard: system health widget (PHP, Laravel, disk, DB size, cache driver)

- Global session flash → Alpine store bridge for all controllers
- Full EN/BG i18n coverage for new UI

### Changed
- Admin layout: full-page dark blue geometric background image (`public/images/bg.jpg`), sidebar and topbar transparent

## [1.1.2] — 2026-06-11
### Fixed
- Sidebar: Alpine `:style` string was replacing entire style attr (losing display:flex) — switched to object syntax `{ width: ... }`
- Sidebar: user avatar + collapse button centered when collapsed, visible chevron `›`

## [1.1.1] — 2026-06-11
### Fixed
- Sidebar: collapse button arrow smaller (14px single chevron, not double arrow)
- Sidebar: html/body height:100%+overflow:hidden so nav fills full height and user+collapse stays pinned at bottom

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-11
### Fixed
- Admin layout: complete redesign — Linear/DataNest style sidebar, proper active states, user info at bottom, collapse button
- Settings page: settings table migration was missing (now runs on deploy)
- Alert Dialog: hardcoded DELETE method — now accepts `method` prop (suspend uses PATCH)
- `$errors` null guard in create/edit views (safe outside web middleware)
